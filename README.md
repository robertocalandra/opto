This package offer a flexible framework to implement optimizers for Python.
Moreover, some standard algorithms are currently implemented:

- Bayesian optimization

To have more details about the features available on the package have a look at the examples.



## Installation

To install the package clone the repository, and manually install the package using::

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertocalandra/opto.git 
cd opto
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```
	
Note: the DIRECT algorithm currently is just an interface to a FORTRAN implementation of DIRECT. For this reason it is necessary to install a FORTRAN compiler using::

```bash 
sudo apt-get install gfortran
```
